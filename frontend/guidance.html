    <h1>Guidance of the Reporting Process</h1>
    <h2>I'm too embarassed, how could I be so stupid?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't feel ashamed, scams can target anyone!</li>
        <li>You may also be more vulnerable during certain time periods, such as finding a job.</li>
        <li>You are not alone. Scams are the most common crime that occurs in the UK.</li>
        <li>The social stigma, though, means that they are under reported.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>I'm worried I might get in trouble for being a victim</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is better to be proactive than to try and hide it, or pretend it never happened.</li>
        <li>Certain scams, such as Money Mules, could have serious consequences if you are caught.</li>
        <li>However, the punishments only apply to people who aren't cooperative or truthful.</li>

    <h2>I don't know where to even start?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you get a suspicious call, hang up and call 159!</li>
